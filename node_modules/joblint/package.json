Now you can run the following commands to lint and test the code.\n\n```sh\n$ make lint  # Run JSHint on the code\n$ make test  # Run unit tests\n```\n\nPlease ensure there are no lint errors or failing tests before opening a pull request.\n\n\nThanks\n------\n\nThe following excellent people helped massively with defining the lint rules:\n\n- [Ben Darlow](http://www.kapowaz.net/)\n- [Perry Harlock](http://www.phwebs.co.uk/)\n- [Glynn Phillips](http://www.glynnphillips.co.uk/)\n- [Laura Porter](https://twitter.com/laurabygaslight)\n- [Jude Robinson](https://twitter.com/j0000d)\n- [Luke Stavenhagen](https://twitter.com/stavi)\n- [Andrew Walker](https://twitter.com/moddular)\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nJoblint is licensed under the [MIT][mit] license.\n\n\n\n[mit]: http://opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php\n[node]: http://nodejs.org/\n[travis]: https://travis-ci.org/rowanmanning/joblint\n[travis-img]: https://travis-ci.org/rowanmanning/joblint.png?branch=master\n",
